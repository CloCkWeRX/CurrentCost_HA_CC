# CurrentCost Custom Component for Home Assistant

This repo is a custom component for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)

The `currentcost` sensor platform is using the data provided by a [CurrentCost](http://www.currentcost.com/) device connected to the serial port via a [data cable](http://www.currentcost.com/product-datacable.html).

The sensor returns the Total Power (usually on Appliance 0) as a state, and the temperature as an attribute.
It is also possible to list additional appliances by listing the appliance number that CurrentCost devices are paired with

Confirmed working devices:
- Currentcost EnviR


## Configuration

To setup a CurrentCost sensor to your installation:
1) Create a folder called `custom_components` in your config folder (same folder where configuration.yaml is locate, if that folder does not already exist)
2) Create a folder called `currentcost` (no spaces, lowercase)
3) Copy the files from this repo into the `currentcost` folder
4) Add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file under the `sensor` header:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
  - platform: currentcost
