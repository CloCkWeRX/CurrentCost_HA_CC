##Usage:

Add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file under the `sensor:` header:

```yaml
  - platform: currentcost
    serial_port: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Prolific_Technology_Inc._USB-Serial_Controller-if00-port0
    name: Current Cost
    baudrate: 57600
    devices:
      - 0
      - 2
      - 9

  - platform: template
    sensors:
      currentcost_temperature:
        entity_id: sensor.current_cost
        unit_of_measurement: 'Â°C'
        value_template: '{{ state_attr("sensor.current_cost", "Temperature") }}'
        friendly_name: CurrentCost Temperature
      currentcost_power:
        entity_id: sensor.current_cost
        unit_of_measurement: 'W'
        value_template: '{{ state_attr("sensor.current_cost", "Appliance 0") }}'
        friendly_name: CurrentCost Power
      dehumidifier_power:
        entity_id: sensor.current_cost
        unit_of_measurement: 'W'
        value_template: '{{ state_attr("sensor.current_cost", "Appliance 2") }}'
        friendly_name: Dehumidifier Power
```
